# RPG JavaGame
I'm trying to make an RPG game using Java

I already made an instance of the main idea behind the game I want to program. <br>
It was a high-school project that was buggy, and way too simple.

The plan is to sometime move to a game engine (possibly Unity). <br>
I'll probably have to switch to C# for that but from my experience, Java and C# can be relatively similar

# V0.0.1 - Remaking The Game (from the high-school project)

The game map is a 2D array: <br>
[------------------] <br>
[                  ] <br>
[  c               ] ----> 'c' represents a crate <br>
[         o        ] ----> 'o' represents the center of the map which is where the player goes to spawn enemies <br>
[             v    ] ----> 'v' represents the player <br>
[       x          ] ----> 'x' represents the enemy <br>
[------------------]
